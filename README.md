This is my final project for Courera's IBM Data Science Certificate program (October 2021). 
SpaceX's rocket launch is advertised to have an estimated cost of 62 million dollars compared to 165 million dollars or more for other providers. SpaceX's ability to reduce the cost significantly was mainly due to its capability to reuse the first stage of the rockets. This project used data science and machine learning to understand whether the first stage of the rocket would launch successfully, and thus would affect the cost of a launch. 
* Data was collected by using spaceX API and webscraping Wikipedia page.
* Data was cleaned and formatted to maintain its integrity using Python.
* Used Python and SQL to analyze the data.
* Built plots, dash board to help visualize data with Plotly Dash.
* Created an interactive map with Folium.
* Different analysis and machine learning classficiation modells were used to find the best models to use for prediction.

# [How does a Bike-Share navigate speedy success?](https://github.com/huongvo99/bike_sharing_cs)
Cyclistic, a bike_sharing company want to know how its member riders are different from casual riders.
* Import and merge the latest 12 months data of Cyclistic's trips 
* Perform data wrangling using Pandas, Numpy
* Perform data analysis using Python
* Create different data visualization using Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Derive insights into how annual members are different from casual members.
* Recommendation for the marketing team to attract more casual riders to convert to annual membership.
